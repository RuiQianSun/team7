## Overview 
This repository focuses on solving a classification problem -  **A Stroke Prediction**. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. In this project, we train multiple machine learning models on a relevant dataset to predict the likelihood of stroke. The goal is to identify key features that influence stroke risk and develop an accurate predictive model for better healthcare outcomes.
