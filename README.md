## Overview 
This repository focuses on solving a classification problem -  **A Stroke Prediction**. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. In this project, we train multiple machine learning models on a relevant dataset to predict the likelihood of stroke. The goal is to identify key features that influence stroke risk and develop an accurate predictive model for better healthcare outcomes.

## Goals
 To identify key features that influence stroke risk and develop an accurate predictive model for better healthcare outcomes

## Techniques
Before preceedings to the training the model, we understand the data and perform the preprocessing. During the pre-processing, we update the missing numeric values with its mean, categorize the non-numeric values, and standardize the numeric ones.
